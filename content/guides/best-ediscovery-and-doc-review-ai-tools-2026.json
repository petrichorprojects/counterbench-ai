  "year": 2026,
  "tldr": "In eDiscovery and document review, AI is valuable when it helps you triage faster without losing defensibility. In 2026, choose tools that support repeatable workflows: collections, search, batching, audit trails, and reviewer quality checks. Use AI for prioritization and summaries, but keep your review protocol, sampling strategy, and privilege controls explicit. If you can’t explain how results were produced, you can’t defend them.",

    "Define the review goal: privilege review, responsiveness, issue tagging, or chronology building.",
    "Require auditability: search terms, models used, reviewer decisions, and sampling results.",

    {

      "a": "It can be, if you have a written protocol, audit logs, and a sampling/QA plan. Treat AI as workflow acceleration, not as the decision-maker."

      "q": "What should an AI review protocol include?",

      "q": "How do I avoid privilege mistakes?",
      "a": "Use explicit privilege filters, train reviewers on escalation, and run targeted QA sampling for privileged indicators. Don’t rely on AI alone."

      "q": "What metrics matter?",
      "a": "Time-to-first-relevant doc, reviewer throughput, sampling pass rates, and how often privilege issues are caught before production."
    },
    {
      "q": "Where does AI help most?",
      "a": "Prioritization, summarization, clustering, and chronology building. You still need human judgment for privilege, responsiveness, and strategy."
