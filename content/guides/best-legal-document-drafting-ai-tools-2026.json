  "year": 2026,
  "tldr": "Drafting is where AI can save real time, but only if you enforce structure. In 2026, the best drafting setups combine: a drafting tool that fits your workflow (Word or web), a template library for your firm’s “default clauses,” and a review checklist to prevent omissions. Use AI to generate first drafts and variants, but keep approval gates and require a final human review for material terms, definitions, and jurisdiction-specific requirements.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "q": "What’s the fastest way to improve drafting quality?",
      "a": "Use a fixed template + a checklist + a short prompt framework. Most drafting failures come from missing inputs (parties, scope, governing law, definitions)."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can AI draft a contract from scratch?",
      "a": "It can create a starting draft, but you should treat it as a template. Your firm’s clause defaults, risk tolerances, and jurisdiction requirements must be applied."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I keep drafts consistent?",
      "a": "Force a standard outline and definitions section, then run a consistency pass: definitions, cross-references, dates, notice addresses, and signature blocks."
    },
    {
      "q": "How should I store templates?",
      "a": "Store clause blocks and templates in version control (or a CLM/template system) and maintain a change log so you can track what changed and why."
    },
    {
      "q": "What’s a red flag output?",
      "a": "A document that reads well but provides no assumptions, no missing-input questions, and no verification checklist. That’s how errors slip through."
