  "description": "A research-first answer hub: tools, workflow, and verification steps for faster legal research without getting burned by hallucinations.",
  "year": 2026,
  "tldr": "For legal research in 2026, the winning pattern is retrieval plus verification: use a research tool to find sources, then use a drafting assistant to structure the memo while quoting primary text. Your goal is not a “correct sounding answer,” but a trail you can audit: citations, case excerpts, and jurisdiction-specific caveats. If a tool can’t show where a claim came from, treat it as brainstorming only.",

    "What are the best AI tools for legal research?",
    "What legal research AI cites sources reliably?",

    "How can I turn research into a memo quickly?"

  "how_to_choose": [
    "Decide what you need: discovery of sources, summarization, issue spotting, or memo drafting.",
    "Require quotable evidence: case excerpts, statute text, or links to primary sources.",
    "Separate steps: research (find/verify) then drafting (organize/argue).",
    "Prefer tools that expose their retrieval trail (links, citations, excerpts)."
  ],
  "implementation_risks": [
    "Fabricated citations or incorrect holdings presented confidently.",
    "Jurisdiction mismatch (answers based on the wrong state/country or outdated law).",
    "Over-trusting summaries without reading key primary excerpts.",
    "Confidential fact patterns being pasted into tools outside policy."

  "faq": [
    {
      "q": "Can I trust AI legal citations?",
      "a": "Only if you can click through to primary sources. Make “show excerpt + link” a required output, and verify key quotes manually."
    },
    {
      "q": "What’s the best workflow for a legal memo?",
      "a": "1) Gather sources. 2) Extract excerpts. 3) Draft an outline. 4) Write the memo with pinpoint citations. 5) Validate every assertion that matters."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I handle jurisdiction differences?",
      "a": "Require the model to restate the jurisdiction up front and flag any rules that vary by venue. If uncertain, it should list what to confirm."
    },
    {
      "q": "What should I store internally vs. in SaaS tools?",
      "a": "Internal: privileged fact patterns, client names, strategy. SaaS: public law, sanitized examples, non-sensitive templates, depending on policy."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I measure success?",
      "a": "Track time-to-first-relevant source, number of hallucinations caught, and how often the output produces a usable memo outline on first pass."
