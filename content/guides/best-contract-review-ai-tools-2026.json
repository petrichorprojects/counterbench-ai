  "description": "A practical shortlist for contract review: what to adopt, what to ignore, and what to verify before you operationalize anything.",
  "year": 2026,
  "tldr": "If you need contract review help in 2026, prioritize tools that (1) keep your data boundaries clear, (2) produce structured outputs you can audit, and (3) fit your existing drafting workflow (Word, CLM, email). The best setup is usually one contract intelligence tool plus a repeatable review checklist and prompt pack for summaries, redlines, and fallback positions. Avoid black-box outputs without citations to clause text, and don’t paste privileged data into third-party systems unless your policy and vendor terms allow it.",

  ],
  "how_to_choose": [
    "Pick the workflow first: intake summary, clause extraction, redline suggestions, playbook compliance, or negotiation fallback positions.",
    "Require traceability: every risk or recommendation should point to the exact clause text it depends on.",
    "Decide your data posture: what can go to a SaaS tool vs. what must stay local or in an approved environment.",
    "Start with a single contract type (NDA or MSA), measure time saved, then expand."
  ],
  "implementation_risks": [
    "Privilege and confidentiality leakage (inputs to external services, vendor retention policies).",
    "Hallucinated legal standards or fabricated citations (especially for jurisdiction-specific issues).",
    "Silent format drift (outputs that are hard to audit or inconsistent across reviewers).",
    "Over-reliance on the tool without a human check for material terms and deal context."

  "faq": [
    {
      "q": "Should I let AI redline contracts automatically?",
      "a": "Use AI to propose edits, but keep a human in the loop. Require that every suggestion is justified by a playbook rule or a risk rationale tied to the clause text."
    },
    {
      "q": "What’s the safest way to start?",
      "a": "Start with non-sensitive templates (public forms, prior executed agreements with sensitive data removed) and a single contract type (NDA). Define a checklist and review gates."
    },
    {
      "q": "What outputs should I expect from a good setup?",
      "a": "A clause-by-clause risk list, a redline summary, a negotiation fallback table, and a short business summary for stakeholders."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do I need a playbook?",
      "a": "Yes. Even a 1-page playbook (fallbacks + red flags) massively improves consistency and makes AI outputs auditable."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I prevent hallucinations?",
      "a": "Force the tool to quote the clause text before recommending changes, and add a verification section that flags assumptions and missing inputs."
