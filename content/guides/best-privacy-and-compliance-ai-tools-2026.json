  "year": 2026,
  "tldr": "In privacy and compliance, the objective is defensible process. In 2026, AI is most useful for drafting, gap-checking, and evidence organization, not for making final calls. Choose tools that produce checklists, track decisions, and help you maintain a clear audit trail. If a tool can’t show inputs, outputs, and change history, it’s hard to defend later.",

  ],
  "how_to_choose": [
    "Start with a defined artifact: ROPA, DPIA outline, policy draft, controls checklist, or audit evidence tracker.",
    "Require an audit trail: sources used, assumptions, and what a human verified.",
    "Prefer tools that help you standardize templates and reduce omissions (not “one-shot answers”).",
    "Decide where data lives and how it’s retained before you operationalize anything."
  ],
  "implementation_risks": [
    "Policy drafts that sound correct but miss jurisdiction-specific obligations.",
    "Over-collection of personal data during intake or evidence gathering.",

    {

      "a": "AI can draft, but you must validate jurisdiction-specific requirements and the organization’s actual data practices. Use it to accelerate writing and completeness checks."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the minimum viable compliance workflow?",
      "a": "A checklist + evidence tracker + change log. Run monthly: update policies, validate controls, and record what changed."

    {
      "q": "How do I avoid “policy theater”?",
      "a": "Tie every policy statement to an operational control and owner. If a control doesn’t exist, flag the policy text as aspirational and fix the process."
    },
    {
      "q": "What should never go into an external AI tool?",
      "a": "Sensitive personal data, privileged communications, confidential incident details, or anything your policy forbids. Sanitize inputs or use approved internal tooling."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I measure success?",
      "a": "Fewer omissions in drafts, faster evidence collection, faster audit readiness, and fewer “unknowns” during reviews."
