## Prompt

```text
Rewrite my prompt using the SAID framework so it is unambiguous and produces a usable result.

S (Situation):
{{situation}}

A (Action):
{{action}}

I (Impact):
{{impact}}

D (Detail):
{{detail_requirements}}

Rules:
- If any SAID field is missing, ask up to 5 clarifying questions first.
- Do not add requirements that conflict with the provided details.

Return only the final rewritten prompt.
```
