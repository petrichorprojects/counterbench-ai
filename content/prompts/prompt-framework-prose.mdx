## Prompt

```text
Create a conversational prompt using the PROSE framework.

P (Purpose):
{{purpose}}

R (Role):
{{role}}

O (Owner):
{{owner}}

S (Scope):
{{scope}}

E (Expectations):
{{expectations}}

Requirements:
- Make it feel like a natural conversation, not a rigid checklist.
- Include boundaries: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope.
- Include a short “How we’ll work” section (3-6 bullets).
- If the user asks for something out-of-scope, propose the closest safe alternative.

Return only the final prompt (copy/paste-ready).
```
