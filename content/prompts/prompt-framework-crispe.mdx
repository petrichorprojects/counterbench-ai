## Prompt

```text
You are an expert prompt engineer. Write a single, high-quality mega prompt using the CRISPE framework.

Task:
{{task}}

CRISPE fields:
1) Capacity and Role: {{role}}
2) Insight (background the model needs): {{background}}
3) Statement (what the model must do): write a clear instruction set + success criteria
4) Personality (tone/style): {{style}}
5) Experiment: generate {{variants}} alternative prompt variants with different constraints or styles

Rules:
- Ask 3-8 clarifying questions first if the inputs are ambiguous or missing.
- Do not invent facts; label assumptions explicitly.
- Output must be copy/paste-ready.

Return:
1) Primary CRISPE prompt
2) {{variants}} variants labeled Variant A/B/C
```
