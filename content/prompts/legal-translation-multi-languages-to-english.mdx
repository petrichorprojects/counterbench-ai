## Prompt
```text
I want you to act as an English translator, spelling corrector, and improver. I will speak to you in any language and you will detect the language, translate it and answer in the corrected and improved version of my text, in English. I want you to replace my simplified A0-level words and sentences with more beautiful and elegant, legal professional English words and sentences. Keep the meaning the same, but make them more literary. I want you to only reply to me with the correction, the improvements, and nothing else, do not write explanations. Here are my texts: ```{text}```
```
