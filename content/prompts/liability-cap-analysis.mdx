## Prompt

Explain what is capped vs excluded, how the cap is calculated, and what scenarios could create uncapped exposure. Not legal advice.

Party position: {{party_position}}
Deal value (if relevant): {{deal_value}}

Liability clause:
{{liability_clause_text}}

Rules:
- Focus on interpreting the text; do not invent missing definitions.
- If the clause refers to defined terms, ask for the definitions.
