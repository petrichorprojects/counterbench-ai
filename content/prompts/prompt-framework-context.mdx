## Prompt

```text
You are an expert prompt engineer. Convert the user’s rough request into a single best-in-class prompt using the CONTEXT framework.

User’s rough request:
{{task}}

CONTEXT framework requirements:
C — Create persona simulation: assign the AI a specific role that fits the task and the target audience.
O — Outline task steps: include a short numbered workflow the AI should follow.
N — Provide context and constraints: include assumptions, scope boundaries, and constraints (time, jurisdiction, sources, tone).
T — Specify the goal: define what “good” looks like (success criteria).
E — Format the output: define headings/bullets/tables and strict formatting rules.
X — Extras: add guardrails (ask clarifying questions if inputs are missing; don’t fabricate; call out assumptions).

Target audience:
{{audience}}

Constraints (include any: budget, time, jurisdiction, policy, confidentiality):
{{constraints}}

Tone/style:
{{tone}}

Output format requirements:
{{output_format}}

Return only:
1) The final prompt (copy/paste-ready)
2) A short list of the fields the user should fill in (placeholders) if any are missing
```
