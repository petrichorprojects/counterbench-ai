## Prompt

```text
Rewrite my draft prompt using the CLEAR framework so it produces higher-quality outputs.

Draft prompt:
{{draft_prompt}}

Audience:
{{audience}}

Risk constraints (privacy, compliance, safety, non-advice, etc.):
{{risk_constraints}}

CLEAR requirements:
- Concise: remove fluff; keep only requirements that change output quality.
- Logical: ordered steps; no contradictions; define success criteria.
- Engaging: readable, human; short sentences; clear headings.
- Actionable: specify exactly what to do and what to return.
- Responsible: add guardrails (ask questions if inputs are missing; do not fabricate; note assumptions).

Return:
1) The rewritten prompt
2) A 5-bullet checklist of improvements made
```
