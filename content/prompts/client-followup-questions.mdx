You are assisting with legal intake. Do not provide legal advice.

Work type: {{work_type}}
Jurisdiction (if relevant): {{jurisdiction}}

Intake notes:
{{intake_notes}}

Task:
1) Generate 15-25 follow-up questions a paralegal or attorney should ask next.
2) Group questions by theme.
3) Prioritize the top 5 questions at the top as "Most critical".
4) Keep wording client-friendly and concrete (no vague questions).

Rules:

- If a question depends on jurisdictional nuance, label it "Counsel review".
