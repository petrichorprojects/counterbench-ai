# Counterbench.AI Workspace Label

This is the canonical Counterbench.AI website repo (deploy target: Counterbench.AI).

If you also have a duplicate checkout nested under something like `VerdictOps/counterbench-ai`, do **not** edit or deploy from that copy.

Quick sanity checks:
- `git remote -v` should point at `petrichorprojects/counterbench-ai`.
- The Vercel project for this repo should be `counterbench-ai`.
